5.	Brief reflection (200 words) on setup challenges
I installed the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on my Windows system using PowerShell. Subsequently, I downloaded and installed Ubuntu, accessed it through PowerShell, and began working in the command-line interface (CLI) environment. I also installed and configured the PostgreSQL database.
Initially, working in the CLI environment was somewhat challenging, as it required the use of Linux commands. I was also uncertain about how to restart the process after closing the PowerShell tab. Upon consulting my lecturer, Bobby, I learned how to set Ubuntu as the default environment so that each time a new PowerShell tab is opened, it automatically launches Ubuntu.
During this process, I learned how to create databases and tables, insert data into tables, and display the available databases.
After completing the tasks in the CLI environment, I downloaded and installed DataGrip to manage the PostgreSQL database through a graphical interface. Since DataGrip was a new tool for me, Bobby provided guidance on how to create and connect to specific databases. While establishing the connection, I encountered issues related to the database username and password. With his assistance, I was able to select the correct username and reset the password. Eventually, I successfully connected to the database and explored the feature in DataGrip that automatically generates Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.
